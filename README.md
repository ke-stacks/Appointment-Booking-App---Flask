<h1>Post Natal Depression Calculator and Doctor Appointment Booking System</h1>
This is an application that helps new mothers determine if they may be experiencing postnatal depression (PND). PND is a common mood disorder that affects many women after giving birth, and it can have serious negative impacts on both the mother and her child if left untreated.

The application features a PND calculator that asks the user a series of questions related to their mood, sleep patterns, and other factors that may be indicative of PND. Based on the user's answers, the calculator generates a score that indicates the likelihood of PND, along with recommendations for next steps.

The app also features a chatbot created using Rasa which is a python library. The chatbot is designed to be a companion for mothers with not so severe symptoms of pnd

If the user's score indicates a moderate to high risk of PND, the application offers a doctor appointment booking system that allows the user to easily schedule an appointment with a healthcare professional who can provide further evaluation and treatment.
